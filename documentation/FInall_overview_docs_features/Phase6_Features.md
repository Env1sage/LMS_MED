## 2️⃣ SELF-PACED LEARNING (NEW & SEPARATE)

> Self-paced learning is **non-mandatory**, **non-linear**, and **always accessible**.

### Definition

**Self-Paced Learning** consists of:

* Additional content
* Notes
* Reference material
* Explanatory videos
* Practice resources

Uploaded by **Faculty**, intended for **independent study**.

---

---

# 👨‍🏫 FACULTY PORTAL — **FEATURE UPDATE (ADDENDUM)**
