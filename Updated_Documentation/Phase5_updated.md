📘 PHASE 5
Teacher (Faculty) Portal – Academic Execution, Learning Flow & Assessment Control
(Subject-Level Authority | Core Teaching Engine of the LMS)
This phase defines how teaching actually happens inside the LMS.
All governance, content control, and permissions defined earlier now materialize into real learning experiences.

1. Phase Overview
Phase Name
Phase 5: Teacher Portal – Teaching, Assessment & Subject Analytics
Phase Type
Academic execution phase
